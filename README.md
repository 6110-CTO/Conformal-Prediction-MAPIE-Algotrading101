## Conformal Prediction - A Practical Guide with MAPIE

Conformal Prediction is, in essence, a method for constructing prediction intervals with a guaranteed level of accuracy, regardless of the distribution of the underlying data.

One of the most important advantages of Conformal Prediction is that it allows for the inclusion of uncertainty in predictions. In many traditional machine learning techniques, we often try to optimize for the highest possible accuracy or any other metric. While this may be effective in some cases, it can also lead to overconfidence in our predictions, especially when dealing with complex or noisy data.

Conformal Prediction addresses this issue by providing a way to quantify and communicate the uncertainty in our predictions. This is especially useful in industries where the cost of a wrong prediction is high, such as finance or healthcare.
